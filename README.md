- NOTES & ASIDES
 
    - While I found this challenging, it was also a breakthrough assignment for me. I was able to use the services of an additional tutor and (I hope) the lightbulb went off. YAY!
    - There are certainly some cosmetic enhancements that could be made, but I do believe I have coded an MVP. Incidentally, coding in the reset.css required me to add to my style.css (as expected, I suppose). Lesson learned: add in reset first to know where you stand before coding your custom style sheet.
    - Pseudo files are "throwaways" used in the dev process. Edited and final versions are index and game. Please disregard PSEUDOs for clarity.
    - The most challenging of the pieces were: 1) what needs to go under the document ready function, 2) program flow, 3) callback functions, 4) wrapping code in another function (see flow).
